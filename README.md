# Conclusion

The transition from traditional rice cultivation to vegetable farming in the West Sinjai district, especially in Gunung Perak and Barania villages, reflects a significant shift influenced by economic factors and observations of successful fellow farmers. According to the analysis on farmers' decision with three options: (1) Growing rice, (2) Growing vegetables, (3) Growing both rice and vegetables), it is found that growing vegetables only may offer higher returns and faster cash flow growth compared to other options. This appears to be the most promising option for farmers for the next decade.

While this transition has diversified farmers’ income streams and improved the local community’s diet, challenges such as water scarcity and fertilizer shortages persist, mainly impacting agricultural productivity. Additionally, the potential extinction of local red paddy varieties raises concerns about preserving agricultural biodiversity. Despite these challenges, local farmers continue to adapt by forming cooperative groups to address common issues in their farming activities. 
Looking ahead, sustainable solutions and government support are essential to overcome these challenges and ensure the prosperity of agricultural communities in West Sinjai.
